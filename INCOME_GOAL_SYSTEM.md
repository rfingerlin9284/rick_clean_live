## 🚀 Four-Phase Smart Aggression Strategy

### PHASE 1: BOOTSTRAP (Months 0-3)
**Goal**: Prove system works on small capital with AI hive

- **Capital**: $2,000 → $5,300 (with deposits + P&L)
- **Daily Target**: $100-200/day
- **Win Rate Target**: 60%+
- **Trades/Day**: 3-5 (multiple patterns, multiple timeframes)
- **Risk/Trade**: 2% of capital ($40 initial)
- **Leverage**: 6.6x (required due to small capital)
- **Brokers**: IBKR (crypto futures) + OANDA (when open)
- **AI Hive Role**: Learn patterns, test ML models, document edge cases
- **Success Criteria**: 3 consecutive weeks of +$50-100/day average

**What Happens**:
1. AI hive places 3-5 trades per day using Guardian-enforced rules
2. Each trade risks exactly 2% of capital
3. ML models learn price action patterns
4. Deepseek optimizes position sizing
5. GPT analyzes winning/losing trades for edge discovery
6. RICK orchestrates order flow through Guardian gates

---

### PHASE 2: SCALE (Months 3-6)
**Goal**: Double daily income by scaling positions with growing capital

- **Capital**: $5,300 → $15,000+ (with deposits + P&L)
- **Daily Target**: $300-500/day
- **Win Rate Target**: 60%+ (maintain)
- **Trades/Day**: 2-3 (higher conviction entries only)
- **Risk/Trade**: 2% of capital ($200 initial)
- **Position Scale**: 2.5x leverage (still healthy)
- **Leverage**: 2.85x → 1.81x (decreasing as capital grows)
- **Brokers**: OANDA (EUR/USD, XAU/USD) + IBKR (crypto futures)
- **AI Hive Role**: Execute scaled positions, validate patterns at higher P&L
- **Success Criteria**: Consistent $300-500/day for 1 month

**What Happens**:
1. Capital grows from deposits + Phase 1 profits
2. Position sizes increase proportionally
3. Risk per trade increases ($200+ per trade)
4. AI hive runs concurrent positions (up to 3)
5. Focus shifts to higher-conviction setups only
6. Guardian gates auto-adjust leverage down as capital grows

---

### PHASE 3: AGGRESSIVE (Months 6-12)
**Goal**: Hit full $600/day target with aggressive position scaling

- **Capital**: $15,000 → $25,000+ (organic growth)
- **Daily Target**: $600/day (FULL GOAL)
- **Win Rate Target**: 60%+ (consistency)
- **Trades/Day**: 2-4 (proven patterns only)
- **Risk/Trade**: 2% of capital ($300-500)
- **Leverage**: 3.0x allowed (but typically lower due to capital)
- **Brokers**: OANDA + IBKR + optional Coinbase (if profitable)
- **AI Hive Role**: Execute aggressive positions, identify automation candidates
- **Success Criteria**: $600+/day sustainable for 2+ weeks

**What Happens**:
1. AI hive now runs 2-4 concurrent positions
2. Each broker handles its own asset class
3. Guardian gates enforce correlation limits (stay uncorrelated)
4. GPT identifies which patterns can be automated
5. Deepseek optimizes risk across all positions
6. RICK coordinates multi-broker order flow
7. Profits compound back into capital (no withdrawals yet)

---

### PHASE 4: AUTOMATION (Month 12+)
**Goal**: Sustain $600+/day via automated bots running proven patterns

- **Capital**: $25,000+ (no leverage needed!)
- **Daily Target**: $600-1,000+/day (sustainable forever)
- **Win Rate Target**: 65%+ (must be proven)
- **Bot Triggers**: Only patterns with 60%+ historical win rate
- **Leverage**: 0.5-1.0x (mostly equity, not leverage)
- **Brokers**: All three (diversified asset classes)
- **AI Hive Role**: Monitor bots, optimize automation, scale to $1,000/day
- **Success Criteria**: 30 consecutive days of $600+/day with bots

**What Happens**:
1. Best-performing patterns from Phases 1-3 are automated
2. Bots run independently with Guardian enforcement
3. AI hive monitors performance, not trading
4. Focus shifts to discovering next edge
5. Can now scale to $1,000/day, $3,000/day, etc.
6. System is now sustainable for 10+ years

## 📈 How It Works: Real Example

### Day 1 (Phase 1 - Bootstrap)

```
06:00 ET: IBKR opens (crypto futures 24/5)
          - RICK + GPT + Deepseek analyze BTC price action
          - Consensus: 75% bullish (not 80%, so no aggressive trade)

06:30 ET: Pattern detected: Higher low + RSI < 30
          - All AI members agree: 85% bullish
          - Deepseek calculates: Risk $40 (2% of $2K), Target $60 (1.5:1 R:R)
          - RICK places: BUY 0.01 BTC @ 43,500 (micro contract)
          - Guardian approves (valid stops, target, R:R)
          - EXECUTION: Entry filled at 43,500

09:30 ET: Trade hits $60 target
          - Guardian takes profit
          - Daily P&L: +$60 (Track to +$100-120 for day)

10:00 ET: OANDA opens (5pm Sunday)
          - EUR/USD bullish divergence detected
          - Consensus: 72% (below 80%, so medium position)
          - RICK places: BUY 1,000 units EUR/USD @ 1.0850
          - Risk $40, Target $80 (2:1 R:R)

12:30 ET: EUR trade hits target
          - Daily P&L: +$60 + $80 = +$140
          - WIN RATE today: 2/2 (100%)

End of Day:
  - Capital: $2,000 + $140 profit = $2,140
  - Daily income: $140 (on track for $600+ eventually)
  - Win rate: 100% (target: 60%+, ACHIEVED)
  - AI hive confidence: High (patterns working)
  - Tomorrow: Add 3-5 more trades same pattern
```
