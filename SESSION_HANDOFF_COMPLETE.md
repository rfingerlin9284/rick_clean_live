## 🚀 WHAT AGENT #2 WILL EXECUTE

### Phase 5: Paper Mode Validation (24-48 hours)
**Objective:** Verify all systems work flawlessly in practice mode

**Steps:**
1. Set environment to `ENVIRONMENT=practice`
2. Deploy trading engine: `python3 live_ghost_engine.py`
3. Monitor narration feed: `tail -f narration.jsonl`
4. Collect metrics for 24-48 hours:
   - Win rate (target ≥75%)
   - All 6 systems active
   - Zero crashes
   - P&L positive
5. Document results in `PAPER_MODE_RESULTS.md`
6. If success → Proceed to Phase 6

**Success Criteria (ALL MUST PASS):**
- ✅ 24-48 hours continuous operation
- ✅ Win rate ≥ 75%
- ✅ Zero crashes
- ✅ Zero errors in logs
- ✅ All 6 autonomous systems active
- ✅ P&L positive

### Phase 6: Production Deployment (After Phase 5 Success)
**Objective:** Deploy to live trading with real capital

**Steps:**
1. Create backup: `mkdir -p ROLLBACK_SNAPSHOTS && cp -r . ROLLBACK_SNAPSHOTS/live_backup_$(date +%s)/`
2. Set environment to `ENVIRONMENT=live`
3. Deploy trading engine: `python3 live_ghost_engine.py`
4. Monitor extremely closely for 24 hours
5. Emergency rollback available (< 2 minutes if needed)
6. Document results in `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_RESULTS.md`

**Success Criteria (ALL MUST PASS):**
- ✅ 24 hours clean operation
- ✅ Win rate maintained ≥ 75%
- ✅ Real P&L positive ($$$)
- ✅ Zero crashes
- ✅ Zero errors
- ✅ All broker connections stable

## 📋 HANDOFF PROMPT FOR AGENT #2

**Copy and paste this prompt exactly:**

```
TASK: Execute Phases 5-6 of Maximum Performance Upgrade

CONTEXT: All code is integrated and tested. 6 trading systems ready. 
Your job is pure execution and monitoring (no coding).

PHASE 5 - PAPER MODE VALIDATION (24-48 hours):

Step 1: Read these files from workspace
  - QUICK_DEPLOY_COMMANDS.md
  - PAPER_MODE_VALIDATION.md

Step 2: Set environment to practice
  export ENVIRONMENT=practice

Step 3: Start trading engine
  cd /home/ing/RICK/RICK_LIVE_CLEAN
  python3 live_ghost_engine.py

Step 4: Monitor real-time events (NEW TERMINAL)
  tail -f narration.jsonl

Step 5: Collect metrics for 24-48 hours
  Win rate (target ≥75%)
  All 6 systems active
  Hedges executing
  No crashes
  P&L positive

Step 6: Document results in PAPER_MODE_RESULTS.md

SUCCESS: All metrics pass → Proceed to Phase 6
FAILURE: Any metric fails → Debug and retry

PHASE 6 - PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (After Phase 5 Success):

Step 1: Create backup
  mkdir -p ROLLBACK_SNAPSHOTS
  cp -r . ROLLBACK_SNAPSHOTS/live_backup_$(date +%s)/

Step 2: Set environment to live
  export ENVIRONMENT=live

Step 3: Start trading engine
  python3 live_ghost_engine.py

Step 4: Monitor extremely closely
  tail -f narration.jsonl
  (First 24 hours critical)

Step 5: If ANY issue occurs
  STOP: Ctrl+C
  RESTORE: cp ROLLBACK_SNAPSHOTS/live_backup_*/* .
  INVESTIGATE: Then retry

Step 6: After 24 hours clean operation
  Document results in PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_RESULTS.md
  System is live and ready!

CRITICAL RULES:
- Paper mode ALWAYS comes first (required)
- 24-48 hours minimum (don't cut short)
- Watch narration.jsonl constantly (real-time feedback)
- All 6 systems must be active (verify each)
